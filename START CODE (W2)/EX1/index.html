    <h1>Introduction to HTML!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the world of code! <br>
        Last year, millions of learners from our community started with HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
        Why? <br>
        <strong>HTML is the skeleton of all web pages.</strong> 
        It's often the first language learn by developers, marketers, and designers
        and is core to front-end development work.
    </p>
        HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such <br>
        as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank">images</a>, text or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD13eq_Pmp8&t=1167s" target="_blank">videos</a>.
    </p>
